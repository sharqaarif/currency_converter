Currency Converter GUI application
Introduction:
The code is a simple currency converter application using Python and the tkinter GUI library. It fetches exchange rates from an API and allows the user to convert any amount of currency between the available options. The user selects the currencies to convert and enters an amount, and the application returns the converted value with two decimal places. The code is well-commented, easy to understand, and can be used as a starting point for building more complex GUI applications.
